# Fields 

## Input data
The inputs for the location and magnitude of charge for the point particles is given to the program via data.txt. If there is an accident and somehow the data.txt file is lost there is a hidden backup file included as well. The visualisation should update with every save of the data, meaning that it is not neccessary to rerun the program to change the visualisation.
